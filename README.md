Mazes are amazing: keep running, find the exit if you can! If you are not too happy about getting stuck in the actual maze, you can entertain yourself with a virtual one. In this project, you will write a program that generates mazes and looks for a way out.

What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:
Use arrays to create a simple maze block by block and display the result on the screen.
Using appropriate graph algorithms, enable the program to generate a random maze of a given size.
Create a menu for your program and add the ability to save your maze in a file.
Teach your program to trace a way out of the trickiest mazes.
